<h2>OUR STORY</h2>
<h3>Love At First Song</h3>

<p>August 2013 -  when it all began. I was relaxing in the hot tub (yes... the hot tub in August) and he was reading poolside. A random conversation between two weird souls turned into a beautiful friendship. Two years,  many random adventures, supportive calls and delicious meals later, we decided to jump and give our love a go. 

Best decision EVER!

Now we are getting married and get to spend the rest of our lives falling in love over and over again. Come help us celebrate the most important day of our lives: the joining of two families and the beginning of our happily ever after.
